# git-insight

git-insight is a powerful CLI tool that provides comprehensive statistics on GitHub users, organizations and their repositories. Gain detailed insights into your projects and keep track of key metrics with ease.

## Features

- Track contributions and commit activity
- Monitor pull request statuses and activities
- Analyze entire organizations, with a single command

## Installation

To install git-insight, use npm:

```bash
npm install -g git-insight
```

Alternatively, you can use it without global installation via npx:

```bash
npx git-insight org {github-org-name}
```

## Usage

To get statistics for a specific GitHub organization and repository, use the following command:

```bash
npx git-insight org {github-org-name}
```

> [!important]
> We need to query quite a number of GitHub endpoints to fetch the needed issue, pr, and commit details. A GitHub token must be provided via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Commands

Please run `--help` to get an actual lists of available commands.

```bash
npx git-insight --help
```

### Example

Here's an example command and output:

```bash
npx git-insight org facebook react -s 5
```

Note that the repo name is optional, but especially with larger organizations, recommended.
